1. Using Physics Layers
This is the most efficient and recommended way to exclude collisions between specific colliders.

Steps:
Create Custom Layers:

Go to Edit > Project Settings > Tags and Layers.

Create two new layers, e.g., ColliderA and ColliderB.

Assign Layers to GameObjects:

Assign the ColliderA layer to the first GameObject.

Assign the ColliderB layer to the second GameObject.

Disable Collision Between Layers:

Go to Edit > Project Settings > Physics.

In the Layer Collision Matrix, uncheck the intersection between ColliderA and ColliderB.

Result:
The two colliders will no longer interact with each other, but they will still interact with other colliders as usual.
