3. Increase Fixed Time Step
Unity’s physics engine updates at a fixed time step. If it's too large, fast objects might skip collision checks. Try:

Go to Edit → Project Settings → Time.
Reduce Fixed Timestep (default is 0.02), try 0.01 or 0.005.
This makes physics calculations more frequent, reducing tunneling.
